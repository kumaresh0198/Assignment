1. Explain about class and objects

class:
* class is a blueprint used to create objects.
* In class we can define properties and methods.
* class doesn't occupy memory
eg. Think class is a blueprint to build a house

Objects:
* Object is a instance of class.
* By creating object we can able to access the properties and methods defined in the class.
* when an object is created it allocates memory to store its data.
eg. Actual house is build with help of the house plan.

2. Create a program as  follows:

      Parent Class: Person who can walk,run,sit and has attributes height,weight
      Child Class: Student who has own method study and also can inherit the methods and properties from Person
     Print the results

package oops;

class Person{   
	
// Properties	
	int height;
	int weight;
	
	// Methods
	public void walk() {
		System.out.println("he is walking");
	}
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("he is running");
	}
	public void sit() {
		System.out.println("he is sitting idle");
	}
	
}

public class Student extends Person{  // student acquiring properties and methods of person class

	void study() {    // method
		System.out.println("he is studying");
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		Student obj = new Student();
		obj.height=170;
		obj.weight=75;
		
		// printing the values
		System.out.println("Height is: " + obj.height);
		System.out.println("Weight is: " + obj.weight);

		
		obj.walk(); // from parent
		obj.run();  // from parent
		obj.sit();  // from parent
		obj.study();// from child

	}

}
