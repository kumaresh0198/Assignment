1. How Java is different from other programming languages?
Java is an object-oriented programming language that helps in creating reusable and modular code.
Java can run on any operating system because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform independent.
It provides extensive built-in libraries that support various programming needs such as networking, data structures, and file handling.
Java’s structured and robust design makes applications easy to maintain, scale, and enhance over time.

2. Explain about public static void main(String[] args)
public static void main(String[] args) is the entry point of a Java program.

main: It is the method where the JVM starts the execution of the program.

public: It allows the JVM to access and invoke the method from outside the class.

static: It allows the JVM to call the method without creating an object of the class.

void: It specifies that the main method does not return any value.

3. Write a sample program to print following:
package samplepgms;

public class assingnment {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		System.out.println("  * * *");

		System.out.println(" * * * * *");

	}

}
