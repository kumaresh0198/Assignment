1. What is the difference between Error and Exception? Explain with examples
Error
* A serious problem
* Caused by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
* Not caused by normal programming mistakes
examples:
1.) OutOfMemoryError -> when the jvm runs out of memory.
2.) StackOverFlowError -> when the method call itself too many times.

Exception:
* Occurs during runtime
* Unexpected event that disrupts normal flow
* Can be handled using try-catch
examples:
ArithmeticException -> where it shows error if there is any issue in arithmetic operation.
IOException -> this error occurs when we try to perform some input or output tasks and then some issues occur.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException -> when we try to access an index that is outside the valid range of the defined array.

2. Write a program for handling exception

package oops;

public class Assingment {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		try {  // executes the exception code
            int[] val = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
            System.out.println(val[10]);
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {  // handles the exception
           
        	// e.printStackTrace(); this one shows the error and executes the below code
            
            System.out.println("Index is out of range");// customized message
            
        }finally { // always executes whether exception occurs or not
            System.out.println("This block always executes");
        }

        System.out.println("end of the program");

	}

}
